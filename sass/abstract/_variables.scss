//Variable can be created of colors, padding, margin, border, box-shadows, etc.

//variable are normally used when, suppose if variable is not used and 
//you used a hsl color and you want to change it's hue value and you have
//1000 lines of sass code, it will be convinient to go at every line where 
//color is specified and replacing that hsl value ?

//instead we can create a variable for that colour and use that variable where color 
//is specified, by only changing variable value can change colour specified
//in sass code.
